This folder contains the files, which were used in the T-STorM32 group buy on rcgroups, initiated by geekness in February 2018 (many thx geekness, and mike_kelly). It was comprised of the items

- STorM32 board v3.32m
- NT Imu module v2.11
- NT Motor-Encoder module v2.51E

Corresponding thread at rcgroups: https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?3027947-T-Storm-32-prototype-group-buy

A summary of using these materials for building a T-STorM32 gimbal is found here (thx funth1ngs!): https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showpost.php?p=40180124&postcount=1033

For the Eagle .brd files hold these relations to the original Eagle files:
* 'STorM32 NT BGC v332m sz2u.brd' is different to 'STorM32 NT BGC v330m.brd'. The main change is using SM06B-SRSS connectors instead of SM07B-SRSS connectors.
* 'STorM32 NT imu v211 mini.brd' is identical to 'STorM32 NT imu v211 mini-mpu9250.brd'.
* 'T-STorM32 motor v251E-sq (Encoder).brd' is identical to 'T STorM32 motor v251E-sq.brd'.
* 'T-STorM32 motor v251E-sq (Without Encoder).brd' is identical to 'T STorM32 motor v251E-sq.brd'.

Issues
===========

Two small issues have been found with the Eagle .brd and BOM files for the NT Motor Encoder module v2.51:
* The BOM lists the TLE5012B E3005 (TLE5012BE3005XUMA1) instead of the recommended TLE5012B E1000 encoder chip.
* The Eagle .brd file shows the values for the parts C12 and R1 in confusing locations.
